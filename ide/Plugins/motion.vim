"This plugin relies on <C-e> and <C-y> by default to actually scroll a window.
"You can customize these keys to other combinations like j and k as follows:
let g:comfortable_motion_scroll_down_key = "j"
let g:comfortable_motion_scroll_up_key = "k"

" To prevent the plugin from defining those default key mappings
let g:comfortable_motion_no_default_key_mappings = 1
